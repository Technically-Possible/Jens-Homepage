## ‚úã Prerequisites

### Development

### Production

## üêã Docker Selfhost

Selfhosted means that you're gonna run this website in your own computer, no external server needed. To start you must check the following steps. We're gonna use docker. By this method we will not have cors problems.

1. Install docker, check de [official documentation](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
2. Run the build for the container (.dockerfile) with the following command `docker build -t app .`.
3. After image it's created map a port for running as background with `docker run -d -p 8080:80 app`.

If you followed the steps your site must be running at `http://localhost:8080/` (_if you change the port in the step [3] change 8080 for your desired port_). If in the process you got an error or something work unexpected, please submit a PR.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è _If problems of daemon appears, please run as a superuser. If you're using firefox maybe this [extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/es/firefox/addon/custom-new-tab-page/) will interest you_
